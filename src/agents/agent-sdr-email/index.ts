## Common CTO Pain Points to Address

- Infrastructure complexity slowing AI development
- Managing multiple AI frameworks and tools
- Scaling AI operations without massive DevOps overhead
- Time-to-market pressure for AI features
- Team productivity bottlenecks
- Technical debt from custom AI infrastructure
- Integration challenges between different AI systems

Remember: Write like you're genuinely trying to help solve their problem, not sell them something. Customize based on their specific role and location.

# Message Components

## Subject Line

- Keep it short: 3-5 words maximum
- Use all lowercase letters
- Sound like internal communication, not marketing
- Reference their specific problem or lead magnet
- Avoid: capitals, exclamation points, sales language, buzzwords

## Opening Personalization

- Add greetings and first name
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Sound genuine and conversational
- Reference their company and what they're building
- Acknowledge likely challenges without being presumptuous
- No corporate speak or jargon
- Make it feel personal and researched

## Value Proposition

- 2-3 sentences explaining Agentuity and the free development offer
- Connect directly to their specific problems
- Position free development as solving their immediate pain point
- No buzzwords or marketing language
- Focus on practical benefits they'll care about
- Use positioning like: "Custom agent build," "Proof of concept development," "Complimentary automation build"

## Call-to-Action

- Lead with the free development offer
- Specify time commitment (15 minutes for initial chat)
- Make it about them ("build you a custom agent")
- Offer flexibility ("call" or "quick chat")
- Remove friction with easy response options
- Add geographic customization based on their location

## PS (Postscript)

- Start with "P.S."
- Reinforce the free development offer
- Add urgency: "Limited development slots," "This month only"
- Provide social proof: "Built 50+ custom agents"
- Tease specific benefit: "See your agent running in 48 hours"
- Create curiosity or remove friction: "No strings attached," "Keep the agent regardless"

## Geographic Customization

- If the person is in the South Florida metro area (Palm Beach, Miami, etc), in addition to the demo call-to-action, also offer to meet in-person
- If the person is in the Austin metro area, offer to have them meet with co-founder Jeff

If offering to meet 'in person', make sure to use that phrase and note that the person is in the same city as the co-founder (Rick for South Florida, Jeff for Austin).`;
